# seniorProjectOverheadDoorSensor

This was the code for my high school senior project. It is written in Arduino's language which is similar if not identical to C++.

This code runs in a continuous loop waiting for two signals (+5 volts) on pins 2 and 3. If one of the pins recieves the signal the controller activates a siren for 5 seconds and an emergency light for 30 seconds.

I worked directly with lab technitions to develop design goals for the project, presented a few potential designs to the lab manager, and then delivered a product a few weeks later. This project allowed me to learned a lot about control and how to develop projects within a time line.
